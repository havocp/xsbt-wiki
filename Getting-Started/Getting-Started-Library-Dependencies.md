# Library Dependencies

This page assumes you've read the earlier Getting Started pages, in particular
[[basic build definition|Getting Started Basic Def]],
[[scopes|Getting Started Scopes]], and [[more about settings|Getting Started More About Settings]].

Library dependencies can be added in two ways:

 - _unmanaged dependencies_ are jars dropped into the `lib` directory
 - _managed dependencies_ are configured in the build definition and
   downloaded automatically from repositories

## Unmanaged dependencies

Most people use managed dependencies instead of unmanaged. But unmanaged can
be simpler when starting out.

Unmanaged dependencies work like this: add jars to `lib` and they will be
placed on the project classpath. Not much else to it!

You can place test jars such as [ScalaCheck], [specs], and [ScalaTest] in
`lib` as well.

Dependencies in `lib` go on all the classpaths (for `compile`, `test`,
`run`, and `console`). If you wanted to change the classpath for just one of
those, you would adjust `dependencyClasspath in Compile` or
`dependencyClasspath in Runtime` for example. You could use `~=` to get the
previous classpath value, filter some entries out, and return a new
classpath value. See [[more about settings|Getting Started More About Settings]] for details of `~=`.

There's nothing to add to `build.sbt` to use unmanaged dependencies, though
you could change the `unmanaged-base` key if you'd like to use a different
directory rather than `lib`.

To use `custom_lib` instead of `lib`:

```scala
unmanagedBase <<= baseDirectory { base => base / "custom_lib" }
```

`baseDirectory` is the project's root directory, so here you're changing
`unmanagedBase` depending on `baseDirectory`, using `<<=` as explained in
[[more about settings|Getting Started More About Settings]].

There's also an `unmanaged-jars` task which lists the jars from the
`unmanaged-base` directory. If you wanted to use multiple directories or do
something else complex, you might need to replace the whole `unmanaged-jars`
task with one that does something else.

## Managed Dependencies

sbt uses [Apache Ivy] to implement managed dependencies, so if you're
familiar with Maven or Ivy, you won't have much trouble.

### The `libraryDependencies` key

Most of the time, you can simply list your dependencies in the setting
`libraryDependencies`. It's also possible to write a Maven POM file or Ivy
configuration file to externally configure your dependencies, and have sbt
use those external configuration files. You can learn more about that
[[here|Library Management]].

Declaring a dependency looks like this, where `groupId`, `artifactId`, and
`revision` are strings:

```scala
libraryDependencies += groupID % artifactID % revision
```

or like this, where `configuration` is also a string:

```scala
libraryDependencies += groupID % artifactID % revision % configuration
```

`libraryDependencies` is declared in [Keys] like this:

```scala
val libraryDependencies = SettingKey[Seq[ModuleID]]("library-dependencies", "Declares managed dependencies.")
```

The `%` methods create `ModuleID` objects from strings, then you add those
`ModuleID` to `libraryDependencies`.

Of course, sbt (via Ivy) has to know where to download the module. If
your module is in one of the default repositories sbt comes with, this will
just work. For example, Apache Derby is in a default repository:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.apache.derby" % "derby" % "10.4.1.3"
```

If you type that in `build.sbt` and then `update`, sbt should download
Derby to `~/.ivy2/cache/org.apache.derby/`.  (By the way, `update` is a
dependency of `compile` so there's no need to manually type `update` most of
the time.)

Of course, you can also use `++=` to add a list of dependencies all at once:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
	groupID % artifactID % revision,
	groupID % otherID % otherRevision
)
```

And in rare cases you might find reasons to use `:=`, `<<=`, `<+=`,
etc. with `libraryDependencies` as well.

### Getting the right Scala version with `%%`

If you use `groupID %% artifactID % revision` rather than `groupID %
artifactID % revision` (the difference is the double `%%` after the
groupID), sbt will add your project's Scala version to the artifact name.
This is just a shortcut. You could write this without the `%%`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scala-tools" % "scala-stm_2.9.1" % "0.3"
```

Assuming the `scalaVersion` for your build is `2.9.1`, the following is
identical:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scala-tools" %% "scala-stm" % "0.3"
```

The idea is that many dependencies are compiled for multiple Scala versions,
and you'd like to get the one that matches your project.

The complexity in practice is that often a dependency will work with a slightly different Scala version; but `%%` is not smart about that. So if
the dependency is available for `2.9.0` but you're using `scalaVersion :=
"2.9.1"`, you won't be able to use `%%` even though the `2.9.0` dependency
likely works. If `%%` stops working just go see which versions the
dependency is really built for, and hardcode the one you think will work
(assuming there is one).

See [[Cross Build]] for some more detail on this.

### Ivy revisions

The `revision` in `groupID % artifactID % revision` does not have to be a
single fixed version. Ivy can select the latest revision of a module
according to constraints you specify.  Instead of a fixed revision like
`"1.6.1"`, you specify `"latest.integration"`, `"2.9.+"`, or
`"[1.0,)"`.  See the [Ivy revisions] documentation for details.

### Resolvers

Not all packages live on the same server; sbt uses the standard Maven2
repository and the Scala Tools Releases
(<http://scala-tools.org/repo-releases>) repositories by default. If your
dependency isn't on one of the default repositories, you'll have to add a
_resolver_ to help Ivy find it.

To add an additional repository, use

```scala
resolvers += name at location
```

For example:

```scala
resolvers += "Scala-Tools Maven2 Snapshots Repository" at "http://scala-tools.org/repo-snapshots"
```

The `resolvers` key is defined in [Keys] like this:

```scala
val resolvers = SettingKey[Seq[Resolver]]("resolvers", "The user-defined additional resolvers for automatically managed dependencies.")
```

The `at` method creates a `Resolver` object from two strings.

sbt can search your local Maven repository if you add it as a repository:

```scala
resolvers += "Local Maven Repository" at "file://"+Path.userHome.absolutePath+"/.m2/repository"
```

See [[Resolvers]] for details on defining other types of repositories.

### Overriding default resolvers

`resolvers` does not contain the default resolvers; only additional ones
added by your build definition.

`sbt` combines `resolvers` with some default repositories to form
`external-resolvers`.

Therefore, to change or remove the default resolvers, you would need to
override `external-resolvers` instead of `resolvers`.

### Per-configuration dependencies

Often a dependency is used by your test code (in `src/test/scala`, which is
compiled by the `Test` configuration) but not your main code.

If you want a dependency to show up in the classpath only for the `Test`
configuration and not the `Compile` configuration, add `% "test"` like this:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.apache.derby" % "derby" % "10.4.1.3" % "test"
```

Now, if you type `show compile:dependency-classpath` at the sbt interactive
prompt, you should not see derby. But if you type `show
test:dependency-classpath`, you should see the derby jar in the list.

Typically, test-related dependencies such as [ScalaCheck], [specs], and
[ScalaTest] would be defined with `% "test"`.
