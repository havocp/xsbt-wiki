# Directory structure

[[Previous|Getting Started Hello]] _Getting Started Guide page 4 of 14._ [[Next|Getting Started Running]]

This page assumes you've [[installed sbt|Getting Started Setup]] and seen the [[Hello, World|Getting Started Hello]].

## Base directory

In sbt's terminology, the "base directory" is the directory containing the
project. So if you created a project `hello` containing `hello/build.sbt`
and `hello/hw.scala` as in the [[Hello, World|Getting Started Hello]] example, `hello`
is your base directory.

## Source code

Source code can be placed in the project's base directory as with
`hello/hw.scala`. However, most people don't do this for real projects; too
much clutter.

sbt uses the same directory structure as [Maven] for source files by default
(all paths are relative to the base directory):

```text
  src/
    main/
      resources/
         <files to include in main jar here>
      scala/
         <main Scala sources>
      java/
         <main Java sources>
    test/
      resources
         <files to include in test jar here>
      scala/
         <test Scala sources>
      java/
         <test Java sources>
```

Other directories in `src/` will be ignored.  Additionally, all hidden directories will be ignored.

## sbt build definition files

You've already seen `build.sbt` in the project's base directory. Other sbt
files appear in a `project` subdirectory.

`project` can contain `.scala` files, which are combined with
`.sbt` files to form the complete build definition. See
[[.scala build definitions|Getting Started Full Def]] for more.

```text
  build.sbt
  project/
    Build.scala
```

You may see `.sbt` files inside `project/` but they are not equivalent to
`.sbt` files in the project's base directory. Explaining this will
[[come later|Getting Started Full Def]], since you'll need some background
information first.

## Build products

Generated files (compiled classes, packaged jars, managed files, caches, and documentation) will be written to the `target` directory by default.

## Configuring version control

Your `.gitignore` (or equivalent for other version control systems) should contain:

```text
  target/
```

Note that this deliberately has a trailing `/` (to match only
directories) and it deliberately has no leading `/` (to match
`project/target/` in addition to plain `target/`).
