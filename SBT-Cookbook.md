Sometimes you want to understand your tools deeply, and sometimes you just want to get something done. The SBT Cookbook is a problem- and solution-focused adjunct to the [main SBT documentation](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki) whose goal is to get you moving as quickly as possible.

We hope the cookbook will be a community effort, so please submit recipes as you learn how to do something cool - or mundane - with SBT. You might save a fellow Scala coder a lot of time and effort! (Entries shown below without a link are particularly in need of being filled in.)

### Getting started
* [[Install SBT|Recipe: Install SBT]]
* Set up a new project to build with SBT
* Run SBT from the command line and execute basic commands
* Use continuous compilation

### Build file basics
* Set up a minimal build file
* Understand the difference between "light" and "full" build files
* Add a managed dependency to a build file
* Add a jar library to a build as a dependency
* Add a repository to a build file

### Executing your programs
* Run your program in its own VM
* Run your program with a particular version of Scala

### Packaging and Publishing

### Webapps in SBT
* Run your webapp within an embedded jetty server
* Create a WAR that can be deployed to an external app server
