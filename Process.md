# External Processes

# Usage

`sbt` includes a process library to simplify working with external processes.  The library is available without import in build definitions and at the interpreter started by the [console-project|Console Project] task.

To run an external command, follow it with an exclamation mark `!`:

```scala
"find project -name *.jar" !
```

An implicit converts the `String` to `sbt.ProcessBuilder`, which defines the `!` method.  This method runs the constructed command, waits until the command completes, and returns the exit code.  Alternatively, the `run` method defined on `ProcessBuilder` runs the command and returns an instance of `sbt.Process`, which can be used to `destroy` the process before it completes.  With no arguments, the `!` method sends output to standard output and and standard error.  You can pass a `Logger` to the `!` method to send output to the `Logger`:

```scala
"find project -name *.jar" ! log
```

Two alternative implicit conversions are from `scala.xml.Elem` or `List[String]` to `sbt.ProcessBuilder`.  These are useful for constructing commands.  An example of the first variant from the android plugin:

```scala
  <x> {dxPath.absolutePath} --dex --output={classesDexPath.absolutePath} {classesMinJarPath.absolutePath}</x> !
```

If you need to set the working directory or modify the environment, call `sbt.Process` explicitly, passing the command sequence (command and argument list) or command string first and the working directory second.  Any environment variables can be passed as a vararg list of key/value String pairs.

```scala
 Process("ls" :: "-l" :: Nil, Path.userHome, "key1" -> value1, "key2" -> value2) ! log
```

Operators are defined to combine commands.  These operators start with `#` in order to keep the precedence the same and to separate them from the operators defined elsewhere in `sbt` for filters.  In the following operator definitions, `a` and `b` are subcommands.

* `a #&& b`   Execute `a`.  If the exit code is nonzero, return that exit code and do not execute `b`.  If the exit code is zero, execute `b` and return its exit code.
* `a #|| b`   Execute `a`.  If the exit code is zero, return zero for the exit code and do not execute `b`.  If the exit code is nonzero, execute `b` and return its exit code.
* `a #| b`   Execute `a` and `b`, piping the output of `a` to the input of `b`.

There are also operators defined for redirecting output to `File`s and input from `File`s and `URL`s.  In the following definitions, `url` is an instance of `URL` and `file` is an instance of `File`.

* `a #< url` or `url #> a`   Use `url` as the input to `a`.  `a` may be a `File` or a command.
* `a #< file` or `file #> a`   Use `file` as the input to `a`.  `a` may be a `File` or a command.
* `a #> file` or `file #< a`   Write the output of `a` to `file`.  `a` may be a `File`, `URL`, or a command.
* `a #>> file` or `file #<< a`   Append the output of `a` to `file`.  `a` may be a `File`, `URL`, or a command.

There are some additional methods to get the output from a forked process into a `String` or the output lines as a `Stream[String]`.  Here are some examples, but see the [ProcessBuilder API] for details.
```scala
val listed: String = "ls" !!
val lines2: Stream[String] = "ls" lines_!
```

Finally, there is a `cat` method to send the contents of `File`s and `URL`s to standard output.

## Examples

Download a `URL` to a `File`:
```
url("http://databinder.net/dispatch/About") #> file("About.html") !
or
file("About.html") #< url("http://databinder.net/dispatch/About") !
```

Copy a `File`:
```scala
file("About.html") #> file("About_copy.html") !
or
file("About_copy.html") #< file("About.html") !
```

Append the contents of a `URL` to a `File` after filtering through `grep`:
```scala
url("http://databinder.net/dispatch/About") #> "grep JSON" #>> file("About_JSON") !
or
file("About_JSON") #<< ( "grep JSON" #< url("http://databinder.net/dispatch/About") )  !
```

Search for uses of `null` in the source directory:
```scala
"find src -name *.scala -exec grep null {} ;"  #|  "xargs test -z"  #&&  "echo null-free"  #||  "echo null detected"  !
```

Use `cat`:
```scala
val spde = url("http://technically.us/spde/About")
val dispatch = url("http://databinder.net/dispatch/About")
val build = file("project/build.properties")
cat(spde, dispatch, build) #| "grep -i scala" !
```
