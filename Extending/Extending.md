# Extending sbt

This part of the wiki has pages documenting sbt "internals,"
and how to extend them with plugins and commands.

To understand the pages in here, you'll probably need the
[[Getting Started Guide|Getting Started Welcome]] as a foundation.

See the sidebar on the right for an index of topics.
