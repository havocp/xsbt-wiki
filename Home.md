sbt is a build tool for Scala and Java projects that aims to do the basics well. It requires Java 1.6 or later.

## Features
* Easy to set up for simple projects
* [[.sbt build definition|Getting Started Basic Def]] uses a Scala-based "domain-specific language" (DSL)
* More advanced [[.scala build definitions|Getting Started Full Def]] and [[extensions|Getting Started Custom Settings]] use the full flexibility of unrestricted Scala code
* Accurate incremental recompilation using information extracted from the compiler
* Continuous compilation and testing with [[triggered execution|Triggered Execution]]
* Packages and publishes jars
* Generates documentation with scaladoc
* Supports mixed Scala/[[Java|Java Sources]] projects
* Supports [[Testing|testing]] with ScalaCheck, specs, and ScalaTest (JUnit is supported by a plugin)
* Starts the Scala REPL with project classes and dependencies on the classpath
* [[Sub-project|Getting Started Multi-Project]] support (put multiple packages in one project)
* [[External project|External Projects]] support (list a git repository as a dependency!)
* Parallel task execution, including parallel test execution
* [[Library management support|Library Management]]: inline declarations, external Ivy or Maven configuration files, or manual management
