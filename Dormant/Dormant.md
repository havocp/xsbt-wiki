# Dormant Pages

If you check out the wiki as a git repository, there's a `Dormant`
directory (this one) which contains:

 - "redirect" pages (empty pages that point to some new page).
   If you want to rename a page and think it has lots of incoming
   links from outside the wiki, you could leave the old page name
   in here. The directory name is not part of the link so it's
   safe to move the old page into the `Dormant` directory.
 - "clipboard" pages that contain some amount of useful text, that
   needs to be extracted and organized, maybe moved to existing
   pages or the FAQ or maybe there's a new page that should exist.
   Basically content that may be good but needs massaging into the
   big picture.

Ideally, pages in here have a note at the top pointing to
alternative content and explaining the status of the page.
