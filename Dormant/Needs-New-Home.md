Temporarily change the logging level and configure how stack traces are displayed by modifying the `log-level` or `trace-level` settings:

```text
> set logLevel := Level.Warn
```

Valid `Level` values are `Debug, Info, Warn, Error`.

You can run an action for multiple versions of Scala by prefixing the action with `+`.  See [[Cross Build]] for details.  You can temporarily switch to another version of Scala using `++ <version>`.  This version does not have to be listed in your build definition, but it does have to be available in a repository.  You can also include the initial command to run after switching to that version.  For example:

```text
> ++2.9.1 console-quick
...
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.1.final (Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java 1.6.0).
...
scala>
...
> ++2.8.1 console-quick
...
Welcome to Scala version 2.8.1 (Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM, Java 1.6.0).
...
scala>
```

# Manual Dependency Management

Manually managing dependencies involves copying any jars that you want to use to the `lib` directory.  sbt will put these jars on the classpath during compilation, testing, running, and when using the interpreter.  You are responsible for adding, removing, updating, and otherwise managing the jars in this directory.  No modifications to your project definition are required to use this method unless you would like to change the location of the directory you store the jars in.

To change the directory jars are stored in, change the `unmanaged-base` setting in your project definition.  For example, to use `custom_lib/`:

```scala
unmanagedBase <<= baseDirectory { base => base / "custom_lib" }
```

If you want more control and flexibility, override the `unmanaged-jars` task, which ultimately provides the manual dependencies to sbt.  The default implementation is roughly:

```scala
unmanagedJars in Compile <<= baseDirectory map { base => (base ** "*.jar").classpath }
```

If you want to add jars from multiple directories in addition to the default directory, you can do:

```scala
unmanagedJars in Compile <++= baseDirectory map { base =>
	val baseDirectories = (base / "libA") +++ (base / "b" / "lib") +++ (base / "libC")
	val customJars = (baseDirectories ** "*.jar") +++ (base / "d" / "my.jar")
	customJars.classpath
}
```

See [[Paths]] for more information on building up paths.



### Resolver.withDefaultResolvers method

To use the local and Maven Central repositories, but not the Scala Tools releases repository:

```scala
externalResolvers <<= resolvers map { rs =>
  Resolver.withDefaultResolvers(rs, mavenCentral = true, scalaTools = false)
}
```


### Explicit URL

If your project requires a dependency that is not present in a repository, a
direct URL to its jar can be specified with the `from` method as follows:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "slinky" % "slinky" % "2.1" from "http://slinky2.googlecode.com/svn/artifacts/2.1/slinky.jar"
```

The URL is only used as a fallback if the dependency cannot be found through
the configured repositories. Also, when you publish a project, a pom or
ivy.xml is created listing your dependencies; the explicit URL is not
included in this published metadata.

### Disable Transitivity

By default, sbt fetches all dependencies, transitively. (That is, it downloads
the dependencies of the dependencies you list.)

In some instances, you may find that the dependencies listed for a project
aren't necessary for it to build. Avoid fetching artifact dependencies with
`intransitive()`, as in this example:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.apache.felix" % "org.apache.felix.framework" % "1.8.0" intransitive()
```

### Classifiers

You can specify the classifer for a dependency using the `classifier` method.  For example, to get the jdk15 version of TestNG:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.testng" % "testng" % "5.7" classifier "jdk15"
```

To obtain particular classifiers for all dependencies transitively, run the `update-classifiers` task.  By default, this resolves all artifacts with the `sources` or `javadoc` classifer.  Select the classifiers to obtain by configuring the `transitive-classifiers` setting.  For example, to only retrieve sources:

```scala
transitiveClassifiers := Seq("sources")
```

### Extra Attributes

[Extra attributes] can be specified by passing key/value pairs to the `extra` method.

To select dependencies by extra attributes:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org" % "name" % "rev" extra("color" -> "blue")
```

To define extra attributes on the current project:

```scala
projectID <<= projectID { id =>
    id extra("color" -> "blue", "component" -> "compiler-interface")
}
```

### Inline Ivy XML

sbt additionally supports directly specifying the configurations or dependencies sections of an Ivy configuration file inline.  You can mix this with inline Scala dependency and repository declarations.

For example:

```scala
ivyXML :=
  <dependencies>
    <dependency org="javax.mail" name="mail" rev="1.4.2">
      <exclude module="activation"/>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
```

### Ivy Home Directory

By default, sbt uses the standard Ivy home directory location `${user.home}/.ivy2/`.
This can be configured machine-wide, for use by both the sbt launcher and by projects, by setting the system property `sbt.ivy.home` in the sbt startup script (described in [[Setup|Getting Started Setup]]).

For example:

```text
java -Dsbt.ivy.home=/tmp/.ivy2/ ...
```

### Checksums

sbt ([through Ivy]) verifies the checksums of downloaded files by default.  It also publishes checksums of artifacts by default.  The checksums to use are specified by the _checksums_ setting.

To disable checksum checking during update:

```scala
checksums in update := Nil
```

To disable checksum creation during artifact publishing:

```scala
checksums in publishLocal := Nil

checksums in publish := Nil
```

The default value is:

```scala
checksums := Seq("sha1", "md5")
```

### Publishing

Finally, see [[Publishing]] for how to publish your project.

## Maven/Ivy

For this method, create the configuration files as you would for Maven (`pom.xml`) or Ivy (`ivy.xml` and optionally `ivysettings.xml`).
External configuration is selected by using one of the following expressions.

### Ivy settings (resolver configuration)

```scala
externalIvySettings()
```

or

```scala
externalIvySettings(baseDirectory(_ / "custom-settings-name.xml"))
```

### Ivy file (dependency configuration)

```scala
externalIvyFile()
```

or

```scala
externalIvyFile(baseDirectory(_ / "custom-name.xml"))
```

Because Ivy files specify their own configurations, sbt needs to know which configurations to use for the compile, runtime, and test classpaths.  For example, to specify that the Compile classpath should use the 'default' configuration:

```scala
classpathConfiguration in Compile := config("default")
```

### Maven pom (dependencies only)

```scala
externalPom()
```

or

```scala
externalPom(baseDirectory(_ / "custom-name.xml"))
```

### Full Ivy Example

For example, a `build.sbt` using external Ivy files might look like:

```scala
externalIvySettings()

externalIvyFile( baseDirectory { base => base / "ivyA.xml"} )

classpathConfiguration in Compile := Compile

classpathConfiguration in Test := Test

classpathConfiguration in Runtime := Runtime
```

### Known limitations

Maven support is dependent on Ivy's support for Maven POMs.
Known issues with this support:

* Specifying `relativePath` in the `parent` section of a POM will produce an error.
* Ivy ignores repositories specified in the POM.  A workaround is to specify repositories inline or in an Ivy `ivysettings.xml` file.

### Configuration dependencies

The GSG on multi-project builds doesn't describe delegation among
configurations. The FAQ entry about porting multi-project build
from 0.7 mentions "configuration dependencies" but there's nothing
really to link to that explains them.

### These should be FAQs (maybe just pointing to topic pages)
* Run your program in its own VM
* Run your program with a particular version of Scala
* Run your webapp within an embedded jetty server
* Create a WAR that can be deployed to an external app server
