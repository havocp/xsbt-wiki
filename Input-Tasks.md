# Input Tasks

Input Tasks parse user input and produce a task to run.  [[Parsing Input]] describes how to use the parser combinators that define the input syntax and tab completion.  This page describes how to hook those parser combinators into the input task system.

# Input Keys

A key for an input task is of type `InputKey` and represents the input task like a `SettingKey` represents a setting or a `TaskKey` represents a task.  Define a new input task key using the `InputKey.apply` factory method:

```scala
  // goes in <base>/project/Build.scala
  val demo = InputKey[Unit]("demo")
```

# Basic Input Task Definition

The simplest input task accepts a space-delimited sequence of arguments.  It does not provide useful tab completion and parsing is basic.  Such a task may be defined using the `inputTask` method, which accepts a single function of type `TaskKey[Seq[String]] => Initialize[Task[O]]` for some parse result type `O`.  The input to this function is a `TaskKey` for a task that will provide the parsed `Seq[String]`.  The function should return a task that uses that parsed input.  For example:

```scala
demo <<= inputTask { (argTask: TaskKey[Seq[String]]) =>
    // Here, we map the argument task `argTask`
    // and a normal setting `scalaVersion`
  (argTask, scalaVersion) map { (args: Seq[String], sv: String) =>
    println("The current Scala version is " + sv)
    println("The arguments to demo were:")
    args foreach println
  }
}
```

# Input Task using Parsers

The `inputTask` method does not provide any flexibility in defining the input syntax.  To use an arbitrary `Parser` described on the [[Parsing Input]] page for parsing your input task's command line, use the more advanced [InputTask.apply] factory method.  This method accepts two arguments, which will be described in the following two sections.

## Constructing the Parser

The first step is to construct the actual `Parser` by defining a value of type `Initialize[State => Parser[I]]` for some parse result type `I` that you decide on.  `Initialize` is the type that results from using other settings and the `State => Parser[I]` function provides access to the [[Build State]] when constructing the parser.  As an example, the following defines a contrived `Parser` that uses the project's Scala and sbt version settings as well as the state.

```scala
  import complete.DefaultParsers._

val parser: Initialize[State => Parser[(String,String)]] =
 (scalaVersion, sbtVersion) { (scalaV: String, sbtV: String) =>
  (state: State) =>
    ( token("scala" <~ Space) ~ token(scalaV) ) |
    ( token("sbt" <~ Space) ~ token(sbtV) ) |
    ( token("commands" <~ Space) ~
        token(state.remainingCommands.size.toString) )
}
```

This Parser definition will produce a value of type `(String,String)`.
The input syntax isn't very flexible; it is just a demonstration.
It will produce one of the following values for a successful parse (assuming the current Scala version is 2.9.0-1, the current sbt version is 0.10.0, and there are 3 commands left to run):

```scala
("scala", "2.9.0-1")
("sbt", "0.10.0")
("commands", "3")
```

## Constructing the Task

Next, we construct the actual task to execute from the result of the `Parser`.  For this, we construct a value of type `TaskKey[I] => Initialize[Task[O]]`, where `I` is the type returned by the `Parser` we just defined and `O` is the type of the `Task` we will produce.  The `TaskKey[I]` provides a task that will provide the result of parsing.

The following contrived example uses the previous example's output (of type `(String,String)`) and the result of the `package` task to print some information to the screen.

```scala
val taskDef = (parsedTask: TaskKey[(String,String)]) => {
    // we are making a task, so use 'map'
  (parsedTask, packageBin) map { case ( (tpe: String, value: String), pkg: File) =>
    println("Type: " + tpe)
    println("Value: " + value)
    println("Packaged: " + pkg.getAbsolutePath)
  }
}
```

## Putting it together

To construct the input task, combine the key, the parser, and the task definition in a setting that goes in `build.sbt` or in the `settings` member of a `Project` in `project/Build.scala`:

```scala
demo <<= InputTask(parser)(taskDef)
```
