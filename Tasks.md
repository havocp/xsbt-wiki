# Tasks

# Introduction

sbt 0.10 has a new task system that integrates with the new settings system.
Both settings and tasks produce values, but there are two major differences between them:

1. Settings are evaluated at project load time.  Tasks are executed on demand, often in response to a command from the user.
2. At the beginning of project loading, settings and their dependencies are fixed.  Tasks can introduce new tasks during execution, however.  (Tasks have flatMap, but Settings do not.)

# Features

There are several features of the task system:

1. By integrating with the settings system, tasks can be added, removed, and modified as easily and flexibly as settings.
2. [[Input Tasks]], the successor to method tasks, use [[parser combinators|Parsing Input]] to define the syntax for their arguments.  This allows flexible syntax and tab-completions in the same way as [[Commands]].
3. Tasks produce values.  Other tasks can access a task's value with the `map` and `flatMap` methods.
4. The `flatMap` method allows dynamically changing the structure of the task graph.  Tasks can be injected into the execution graph based on the result of another task.
5. There are ways to handle task failure, similar to `try/catch/finally`.
6. Each task has access to its own Logger that by default persists the logging for that task at a more verbose level than is initially printed to the screen.

These features are discussed in detail in the following sections.
The context for the code snippets will be either the body of a `Build` object in a [[Full Configuration]] or an expression in a `build.sbt` [[Basic Configuration]].

# Defining a New Task

## Hello World example

project/Build.scala

```scala

import sbt._
import Keys._

object HelloBuild extends Build {
  val hwsettings = Defaults.defaultSettings ++ Seq(
    organization := "hello",
    name         := "world",
    version      := "1.0-SNAPSHOT",
    scalaVersion := "2.9.0-1"
  )

  val hello = TaskKey[Unit]("hello", "Prints 'Hello World'")

  val helloTask = hello := {
    println("Hello World")
  }

  lazy val project = Project (
    "project",
    file ("."),
    settings = hwsettings ++ Seq(helloTask)
  )
}

```

Run "sbt hello" from command line to invoke the task. Run "sbt tasks" to see this task listed.

## Define the key

To declare a new task, define a `TaskKey` in your [[Full Configuration]]:
```scala
val sampleTask = TaskKey[Int]("sample-task")
```

The name of the `val` is used when referring to the task in Scala code.
The string passed to the `TaskKey` method is used at runtime, such as at the command line.
By convention, the Scala identifier is camelCase and the runtime identifier is separated by dashes.
The type parameter passed to `TaskKey` (here, `Int`) is the type of value produced by the task.

We'll define a couple of other of tasks for the examples:
```scala
val intTask = TaskKey[Int]("int-task")
val stringTask = TaskKey[String]("string-task")
```

The examples themselves are valid entries in a `build.sbt` or can be provided as part of a sequence to `Project.settings` (see [[Full Configuration]]).

## Implement the task

There are three main parts to implementing a task once its key is defined:

1. Determine the settings and other tasks needed by the task.  They are the task's inputs.
2. Define a function that takes these inputs and produces a value.
3. Determine the scope the task will go in.

These parts are then combined like the parts of a setting are combined.

### Tasks without inputs

A task that takes no arguments can be defined using `:=`
```scala
intTask := 1 + 2

stringTask := System.getProperty("user.name")

sampleTask := {
  val sum = 1 + 2
  println("sum: " + sum)
  sum 
}
```
As mentioned in the introduction, a task is evaluated on demand.
Each time `sample-task` is invoked, for example, it will print the sum.
If the username changes between runs, `string-task` will take different values in those separate runs.
(Within a run, each task is evaluated at most once.)
In contrast, settings are evaluated once on project load and are fixed until the next reload.

### Tasks with inputs

Tasks with other tasks or settings as inputs are defined using `<<=`.
The right hand side will typically call `map` or `flatMap` on other settings or tasks.
(Contrast this with the `apply` method that is used for settings.)
The function argument to `map` or `flatMap` is the task body.
The following are equivalent ways of defining a task that adds one to value produced by `int-task` and returns the result.
```scala
sampleTask <<= intTask map { (count: Int) => count + 1 }

sampleTask <<= intTask map { _ + 1 }
```

Multiple inputs are handled as with settings.
The `map` and `flatMap` are done on a tuple of inputs:
```scala
stringTask <<= (sampleTask, intTask) map { (sample: Int, intValue: Int) =>
	"Sample: " + sample + ", int: " + intValue
}
```

### Task Scope

As with settings, tasks can be defined in a specific scope.
For example, there are separate `compile` tasks for the `compile` and `test` scopes.
The scope of a task is defined the same as for a setting.
In the following example, `test:sample-task` uses the result of `compile:int-task`.
```scala
sampleTask.in(Test) <<= intTask.in(Compile).map { (intValue: Int) => 
	intValue * 3
}

// more succinctly:
sampleTask in Test <<= intTask in Compile map { _ * 3 }
```

### Inline task keys

Although generally not recommended, it is possible to specify the task key inline:

```scala
TaskKey[Int]("sample-task") in Test <<= TaskKey[Int]("int-task") in Compile map { _ * 3 }
```

The type argument to `TaskKey` must be explicitly specified because of `SI-4653`.  It is not recommended because:

1. Tasks are no longer referenced by Scala identifiers (like `sampleTask`), but by Strings (like `"sample-task"`)
2. The type information must be repeated.
3. Keys should come with a description, which would need to be repeated as well.

### On precedence

As a reminder, method precedence is by the name of the method.

1. Assignment methods have the lowest precedence.  These are methods with names ending in `=`, except for `!=`, `<=`, `>=`, and names that start with `=`.
2. Methods starting with a letter have the next highest precedence.
3. Methods with names that start with a symbol and aren't included in 1. have the highest precedence.  (This category is divided further according to the specific character it starts with.  See the Scala specification for details.)

Therefore, the second variant in the previous example is equivalent to the following:
```scala
(sampleTask in Test) <<= (intTask in Compile map { _ * 3 })
```

# Modifying an Existing Task

The examples in this section use the following key definitions, which would go in a `Build` object in a [[Full Configuration]].  Alternatively, the keys may be specified inline, as discussed above.
```scala
val unitTask = TaskKey[Unit]("unit-task")
val intTask = TaskKey[Int]("int-task")
val stringTask = TaskKey[String]("string-task")
```
The examples themselves are valid settings in a `build.sbt` file or as part of a sequence provided to `Project.settings`.

In the general case, modify a task by declaring the previous task as an input.
```scala
// initial definition
intTask := 3

// overriding definition that references the previous definition
intTask <<= intTask map { (value: Int) => value + 1 }
```

Completely override a task by not declaring the previous task as an input.
Each of the definitions in the following example completely overrides the previous one.
That is, when `int-task` is run, it will only print `#3`.
```scala
intTask := {
	println("#1")
	3
}

intTask := {
	println("#2")
	5
}

intTask <<= sampleTask map { (value: Int) => 
	println("#3")
	value - 3
}
```

To apply a transformation to a single task, without using additional tasks as inputs, use `~=`.
This accepts the function to apply to the task's result:
```scala
intTask := 3

// increment the value returned by intTask
intTask ~= { (x: Int) => x + 1 }
```

# Task Operations

The previous sections used the `map` method to define a task in terms of the results of other tasks.
This is the most common method, but there are several others.
The examples in this section use the task keys defined in the previous section.

## Dependencies

To depend on the side effect of some tasks without using their values and without doing additional work, use `dependOn` on a sequence of tasks.
The defining task key (the part on the left side of `<<=`) must be of type `Unit`, since no value is returned.

```scala
unitTask <<= Seq(stringTask, sampleTask).dependOn
```

To add dependencies to an existing task without using their values, call `dependsOn` on the task and provide the tasks to depend on.
For example, the second task definition here modifies the original to require that `string-task` and `sample-task` run first:
```scala
intTask := 4

intTask <<= intTask.dependsOn(stringTask, sampleTask)
```

## Streams: Per-task logging

New in sbt 0.10 are per-task loggers, which are part of a more general system for task-specific data called Streams.  This allows controlling the verbosity of stack traces and logging individually for tasks as well as recalling the last logging for a task.  Tasks also have access to their own persisted binary or text data.

To use Streams, `map` or `flatMap` the `streams` task.  This is a special task that provides an instance of [TaskStreams] for the defining task.  This type provides access to named binary and text streams, named loggers, and a default logger.  The default [Logger], which is the most commonly used aspect, is obtained by the `log` method:
```scala
myTask <<= streams map { (s: TaskStreams) =>
  s.log.debug("Saying hi...")
  s.log.info("Hello!")
}
```

You can scope logging settings by the specific task's scope:
```scala
logLevel in myTask := Level.Debug

traceLevel in myTask := 5
```

To obtain the last logging output from a task, use the `last` command:
```scala
$ last my-task
[debug] Saying hi...
[info] Hello!
```

The verbosity with which logging is persisted is controlled using the `persist-log-level` and `persist-trace-level` settings.
The `last` command displays what was logged according to these levels.
The levels do not affect already logged information.

## Handling Failure

This section discusses the `andFinally`, `mapFailure`, and `mapR` methods, which are used to handle failure of other tasks.

### andFinally

The `andFinally` method defines a new task that runs the original task and evaluates a side effect regardless of whether the original task succeeded.
The result of the task is the result of the original task.
For example:

```scala
intTask := error("I didn't succeed.")

intTask <<= intTask andFinally { println("andFinally") }
```

This modifies the original `intTask` to always print "andFinally" even if the task fails.

Note that `andFinally` constructs a new task.
This means that the new task has to be invoked in order for the extra block to run.
This is important when calling andFinally on another task instead of overriding a task like in the previous example.
For example, consider this code:
```scala
intTask := error("I didn't succeed.")

otherIntTask <<= intTask andFinally { println("andFinally") }
```

If `int-task` is run directly, `other-int-task` is never involved in execution.
This case is similar to the following plain Scala code:
```scala
def intTask: Int =
  error("I didn't succeed.")

def otherIntTask: Int =
  try { intTask }
  finally { println("finally") }

intTask()
```

It is obvious here that calling intTask() will never result in "finally" being printed.

### mapFailure

`mapFailure` accepts a function of type `Incomplete => T`, where `T` is a type parameter.
In the case of multiple inputs, the function has type `Seq[Incomplete] => T`.
[Incomplete] is an exception with information about any tasks that caused the failure and any underlying exceptions thrown during task execution.
The resulting task defined by `mapFailure` fails if its input succeeds and evaluates the provided function if it fails.

For example:
```scala
intTask := error("Failed.")

intTask <<= intTask mapFailure { (inc: Incomplete) =>
	println("Ignoring failure: " + inc)
	3
}
```
This overrides the `int-task` so that the original exception is printed and the constant `3` is returned.

`mapFailure` does not prevent other tasks that depend on the target from failing.
Consider the following example:
```scala
intTask := if(shouldSucceed) 5 else error("Failed.")

// return 3 if int-task fails.  if it succeeds, this task will fail
aTask <<= intTask mapFailure { (inc: Incomplete) => 3 }

// a new task that increments the result of int-task
bTask <<= intTask map { _ + 1 }

cTask <<= (aTask, bTask) map { (a,b) => a + b }
```
The following table lists the results of each task depending on the initially invoked task:
<table>
 <th>invoked task</th> <th>int-task result</th> <th>a-task result</th> <th>b-task result</th> <th>c-task result</th> <th>overall result</th>
<tr><td>int-task</td> <td>failure</td> <td>not run</td> <td>not run</td> <td>not run</td> <td>failure</td></tr>
  <tr><td>a-task</td> <td>failure</td> <td>success</td> <td>not run</td> <td>not run</td> <td>success</td></tr>
  <tr><td>b-task</td> <td>failure</td> <td>not run</td> <td>failure</td> <td>not run</td> <td>failure</td></tr>
  <tr><td>c-task</td> <td>failure</td> <td>success</td> <td>failure</td> <td>failure</td> <td>failure</td></tr>
<tr><td>int-task</td> <td>success</td> <td>not run</td> <td>not run</td> <td>not run</td> <td>success</td></tr>
  <tr><td>a-task</td> <td>success</td> <td>failure</td> <td>not run</td> <td>not run</td> <td>failure</td></tr>
  <tr><td>b-task</td> <td>success</td> <td>not run</td> <td>success</td> <td>not run</td> <td>success</td></tr>
  <tr><td>c-task</td> <td>success</td> <td>failure</td> <td>success</td> <td>failure</td> <td>failure</td></tr>
</table>

The overall result is always the same as the root task (the directly invoked task).
A `mapFailure` turns a success into a failure, and a failure into whatever the result of evaluating the supplied function is.
A `map` fails when the input fails and applies the supplied function to a successfully completed input.

In the case of more than one input, `mapFailure` fails if all inputs succeed.
If at least one input fails, the supplied function is provided with the list of `Incomplete`s.
For example:

```scala
cTask <<= (aTask, bTask) mapFailure { (incs: Seq[Incomplete]) => 3 }
```

The following table lists the results of invoking `c-task`, depending on the success of `aTask` and `bTask`:
<table>
 <th>a-task result</th> <th>b-task result</th> <th>c-task result</th>
  <tr> <td>failure</td> <td>failure</td> <td>success</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>failure</td> <td>success</td> <td>success</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>success</td> <td>failure</td> <td>success</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td>success</td> <td>success</td> <td>failure</td> </tr>
</table>

### mapR

`mapR` accepts a function of type `Result[S] => T`, where `S` is the type of the task being mapped and `T` is a type parameter.
In the case of multiple inputs, the function has type `(Result[A], Result[B], ...) => T`.
[Result] has the same structure as `Either[Incomplete, S]` for a task result of type `S`.
That is, it has two subtypes:

 * `Inc`, which wraps `Incomplete` in case of failure
 * `Value`, which wraps a task's result in case of success.

Thus, `mapR` is always invoked whether or not the original task succeeds or fails.

For example:
```scala
intTask := error("Failed.")

intTask <<= intTask mapR {
	case Inc(inc: Incomplete) =>
		println("Ignoring failure: " + inc)
		3
	case Value(v) =>
		println("Using successful result: " + v)
		v
}
```
This overrides the original `int-task` definition so that if the original task fails, the exception is printed and the constant `3` is returned.
If it succeeds, the value is printed and returned.
