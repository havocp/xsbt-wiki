# Artifacts


# Selecting default artifacts

By default, the published artifacts are the main binary jar, a jar containg the main sources and resources, and a jar containing the API documentation.  You can add artifacts for the test classes, sources, or API or you can disable some of the main artifacts.

To add all test artifacts:

```scala
publishArtifact in Test := true
```

To add them individually:

```scala
// enable publishing the jar produced by `test:package`
publishArtifact in (Test, packageBin) := true

// enable publishing the test API jar
publishArtifact in (Test, packageDoc) := true

// enable publishing the test sources jar
publishArtifact in (Test, packageSrc) := true
```

To disable main artifacts individually:

```scala
// disable publishing the main jar produced by `package`
publishArtifact in (Compile, packageBin) := false

// disable publishing the main API jar
publishArtifact in (Compile, packageDoc) := false

// disable publishing the main sources jar
publishArtifact in (Compile, packageSrc) := false
```


# Modifying default artifacts

Each built-in artifact has several configurable settings in addition to `publish-artifact`.
The basic ones are `artifact` (of type `SettingKey[Artifact]`), `mappings` (of type `TaskKey[(File,String)]`), and `artifactPath` (of type `SettingKey[File]`).
They are scoped by `(<config>, <task>)` as indicated in the previous section.

To modify the type of the main artifact, for example:

```scala
artifact in (Compile, packageBin) ~= { (art: Artifact) =>
  art.copy(`type` = "bundle")
}
```

The generated artifact name is determined by the `artifact-name` setting.  This setting is of type `(String, ModuleID, Artifact) => String`, where the String argument is the configuration and the String result is the name of the file to produce.  The default implementation is `Artifact.artifactName _`.  The function may be modified to produce different local names for artifacts without affecting the published name, which is determined by the `artifact` definition combined with the repository pattern.

For example, to produce a minimal name without a classifier or cross path:

```scala
artifactName := { (config: String, module: ModuleID, artifact: Artifact) =>
  artifact.name + "-" + module.revision + "." + artifact.extension
}
```

(Note that in practice you rarely want to drop the classifier.)

Finally, you can get the `(Artifact, File)` pair for the artifact by mapping the `packaged-artifact` task.  Note that if you don't need the `Artifact`, you can get just the File from the package task (`package`, `package-doc`, or `package-src`).  In both cases, mapping the task to get the file ensures that the artifact is generated first and so the file is guaranteed to be uptodate.

For example:

```scala
myTask <<= packagedArtifact in (Compile, packageBin) map { case (art: Artifact, file: File) =>
  println("Artifact definition: " + art)
  println("Packaged file: " + file.getAbsolutePath)
}
```

where `val myTask = TaskKey[Unit]`.

# Publishing .war files

A common use case for web applications is to publish the `.war` file instead of the `.jar` file.

```scala
// disable .jar publishing 
publishArtifact in (Compile, packageBin) := false 

// create an Artifact for publishing the .war file 
artifact in (Compile, packageWar) ~= { (art: Artifact) => 
  art.copy(`type` = "war", extension = "war") 
} 

// add the .war file to what gets published 
addArtifact(artifact in (Compile, packageWar), packageWar) 
```

# Defining custom artifacts

In addition to configuring the builtin artifacts, you can declare other artifacts to publish.  Multiple artifacts are allowed when using Ivy metadata, but a Maven POM file only supports distinguishing artifacts based on classifiers and these are not recorded in the POM.

Basic `Artifact` construction look like:

```scala
Artifact("name", "type", "extension")
Artifact("name", "classifier")
Artifact("name", url: URL)
Artifact("name", Map("extra1" -> "value1", "extra2" -> "value2"))
```

For example:

```scala
Artifact("myproject", "zip", "zip")
Artifact("myproject", "image", "jpg")
Artifact("myproject", "jdk15")
```

See the [Ivy documentation] for more details on artifacts.  See the [Artifact API] for combining the parameters above and specifying [Configurations] and extra attributes.

To declare these artifacts for publishing, map them to the task that generates the artifact:

```scala
myImageTask := {
  val artifact: File = makeArtifact(...)
  artifact
}

addArtifact( Artifact("myproject", "image", "jpg"), myImageTask )
```

where `val myImageTask = TaskKey[File](...)`.


# Using dependencies with artifacts

To specify the artifacts to use from a dependency that has custom or multiple artifacts, use the `artifacts` method on your dependencies.  For example:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org" % "name" % "rev" artifacts(Artifact("name", "type", "ext"))
```

The `from` and `classifer` methods (described on the [[Library Management]] page) are actually convenience methods that translate to `artifacts`:

```scala
  def from(url: String) = artifacts( Artifact(name, new URL(url)) )
  def classifier(c: String) = artifacts( Artifact(name, c) )
```

That is, the following two dependency declarations are equivalent:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.testng" % "testng" % "5.7" classifier "jdk15"

libraryDependencies += "org.testng" % "testng" % "5.7" artifacts( Artifact("testng", "jdk15") )
```
